Hi! I'm Christian Rogers, a student and researcher at the University of Utah working on a 4 year BS/MS in computer science, with a double major in applied math

I am currently doing research in mechanistic interpretability of transformers and medical applications of digital signal processing, but am certainly open to more projects!

I have been interested in coding since I was a child, and recently have become fascinated with both cutting edge machine learning programs, and with applying SWE practices to scaling and accelerating research in the field.
