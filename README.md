Hi! I'm Christian Rogers, a student and researcher at the University of Utah working on a 4 year BS/MS in computer science, with a double major in applied math

I work as a researcher in the Neural Plasticity and Rehabilitation Movement Dynamics laboratory, tackling digital signal processing, code/system design, and deep learning for the lab. In addition I am CTO of Webfork: A company designed to use AI to bring affordable high-quality cooking to more homes, and founder of R&J Software House: A freelancing business. Finally, I act as volunteer CTO of AllGood, a charity which brings aid baskets to cancer victims in the Salt Lake City area.

I am currently doing research in mechanistic interpretability of transformers and medical applications of digital signal processing, but am certainly open to more projects!

I have been interested in coding since I was a child, and recently have become fascinated with both cutting edge machine learning programs, and with applying SWE practices to scaling and accelerating research in the field.
